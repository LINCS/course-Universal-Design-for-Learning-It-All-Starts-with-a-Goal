    <content>&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teachers frequently tell learners
how they want them to show what they know. For example, an assignment might
say: Write an essay about what Robert Frost means in his poem "The Road
Not Taken." Sounds reasonable. Right? Wrong! This teacher has infused the
goal (to show what the learner knows about Robert Frost's poem) with how
they must show it (write an essay).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By asking students to write
about the poem the teacher is creating barriers for students who don't have
access to a computer or might struggle with physically typing. To separate the
goal from the means a teacher could simply say to students: Tell me what Robert
Frost means in his Poem, "The Road Not Taken." The teacher could
suggest students draw a picture, write, make a video, or even create a
slideshow. But, by not requiring one format over the other they have created
more access for learners.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
