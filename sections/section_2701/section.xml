  <summary>&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
purpose of this module is to&amp;nbsp;show&amp;nbsp;how goal setting
can&amp;nbsp;increase&amp;nbsp;learner engagement and purpose in adult education classrooms for both the educator and the learner. You will also learn about UDL
strategies and supports to help adult&amp;nbsp;learners overcome barriers to
developing and achieving their goals.&amp;nbsp;To do
this we are going to consider a challenging problem in the form of a&amp;nbsp;case study. A case study is a teaching tool educators use to introduce
concept by sharing a real-world situation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hearing the case-study we
will ask you some questions.&amp;nbsp;The
goal to help you&amp;nbsp;explore how you would solve the problem using
information you already know and background information you already have. At
the close of the module, we will remind you of the problem posed in the case study and ask you to
reflect on your initial responses to see if you have changed your thinking or
might incorporate any of the new material you learned in the module.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you keep track of your
first ideas.&amp;nbsp;Use pen and paper, digital
note-taking, or a video or audio recording of your&amp;nbsp;thoughts; whichever
allows you to best reflect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="@@PLUGINFILE@@/divider-wave-1%20%282%29.png" alt="" width="1920" height="195" role="presentation" class="img-responsive atto_image_button_text-bottom"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
